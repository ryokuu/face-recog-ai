# Door lock Using Face Recognition
## Based on openCV python

![](screenshots/GUI.png)\
This project was made to fulfill the final project of my Artificial Intelligence subject 
This code is based from krishnaik06's github (link below) and i made changes to fix something not correctly working and add simple GUI to operate.
Also i got the references from IqbalLx's github and youtube channel to understand the algorithm.

If you want to try this program, u'll need to install python and opencv library. Also create a folder named "faces data" to store training data  
and "faces" to store captured face inside the main folder (folder that contain all files).

thanks to krishnaik06 and IqbalLx, hence i can finish my final project.
